| 01 | Elevator responds to external floor buttons                  | Passenger uses elevator             | `Elevator::requestFloor(int Floor, Direction d)`             | Allows the elevator to respond to external floor buttons     | Pressing an external button and seeing if the elevator comes to that floor |
| 02   | Elevator responds to internal floor buttons                  | Passenger uses elevator             | `Elevator::requestFloor(int Floor)`                          | Allows the elevator to respond to floor buttons in the elevator | Pressing a button on the elevator panel and seeing if the elevator goes to that floor |
| 03   | Elevator moves between floors                                | Passenger uses elevator             | `Elevator::fulfillRequest()`                                 | This ensures the elevator car can move between one floor to another by handling the requests | Engage with the elevator by calling it and go to a different floor to see if it moves |
| 04   | Elevator can open its doors                                  | Passenger uses elevator             | `Elevator::openDoors()`                                      | Ensures elevator can open its doors                          | - Call an elevator by pressing an external floor button. <br /><br />- Use the door open button. |
| 05   | Elevator can close its doors                                 | Passenger uses elevator             | `Elevator::closeDoors()`                                     | Ensures elevator can close its doors                         | - Engage with the elevator and see if the door closes after. <br /><br />- Use the door close button. |
| 06   | Elevator goes to ground floor during fire alarm              | Fire alarm from building            | `ElevatorControlSystem::activateFireSafetySequence()`        | Allows for proper safety protocol during a fire alarm        | - Press the fire button inside the elevator.<br /><br />- Trigger the building fire alarm through the ECS admin panel |
| 07   | Elevator goes to ground floor during power outage            | Power outage in the building        | `ElevatorControlSystem::activateOutageSafetySequence()`      | Allows for proper safety protocol during a fire outage       | Trigger building power outage through the ECS admin panel |
| 08   | Help button triggers emergency response                      | Control system receives Help signal | `ElevatorControlSystem::helpSafetySequence()`                | Allows the system to respond to help calls                   | Help button is pressed in the elevator panel.<br /><br />- Can test it by not responding to the call and seeing if the ECS dials 911.<br /><br />- You can also test it by responding to the call from the ECS panel to address the emergency |
| 09   | Door obstacle prevents door from closing                     | Door obstacle detected              | `Elevator::closeDoors()`                                     | Ensures doors don't close when there is something obstructing the door from closing | Engage with any operation that closes the elevator doors, i.e press door close button.<br /><br />- Trigger a simulated door obstacle in the ECS Admin Panel to see if doors don't close and the panel shows the error |
| 10   | Overload limit in elevator                                   | Overload detected                   | `Elevator::underLimit()`                                     | Ensures the elevator doesn't move when it surpasses the load limit | Engage in any elevator operation where the door closes.<br /><br />- Trigger a simulated overload in the ECS Admin Panel to see if the elevator responds accordingly and shows the error |
| 11   | Update display floor number                                  | Many                                | `QElevatorPanel::updateFloor(int floor)`                     | Ensures the elevator's display shows the according floor number | Engage with the elevator in any way that moves it up or down and see if the floor updates in the panel |
| 12   | Show warnings on the display                                 | many                                | `QErrorIndicator::setErrorCode(int error)`                   | Ensures elevator's display shows the appropriate warning to the car passengers | Trigger each of the different emergency scenarios in the ECS admin panel or from the elevator panel and see if the error shows in the elevator car |
| 13   | Ring bell                                                    | many                                | `Elevator::fulfillRequest()`                                 | Allows the elevator to ring a bell upon floor arrival        | Have the elevator move to any floor and see if it dings |
| 14   | Illuminate floor buttons when pressed                        | Passenger uses elevator             | `QElevatorButton::on()` and `QElevatorButton::off()`         | Allows for the system to indicate the request has been put in | Interact with any floor button and see if it illuminates |
| 15   | Turn off Illuminated floor buttons when request is fulfilled | Passenger uses elevator             | `Elevator::updateElevatorButtons()` and `Elevator::updateFloorIndicators()` | Allows for the system to clear fulfilled requests            | Have the elevator go to the floor of the pressed button and see if the button illumination turns off |
